Atype A;
Btype B;
Ctype C;

All Atype, Btype, Ctype in the following text, could be:

Xtype
Xtype&
const Xtype&, 

based on what the operator should modify or return 

A @ B
A and b: operands
@: operator

A + B
A - B

// binary operators with no side-effect
A = B + C      
A = B - C     
A = B / C   
A = B > C
A = B && C
A = B < C



// binary operators with no side-effect
A = B @ C  // A will be set to B@C and B and C remain the same
Atype Btype::operator@(Ctype A)const;

// binary operator with side-effect
A = B @ C // A will be set to B@C and B and/or C may change after the operation 


// helper binary operator with no side-effect
A = B @ C // A will be set to B@C and B and/or C may change after the operation 

Atype operator(Btype left, Ctype right);

A = B += C;
A = B = C;

// Prefix Unary operators with no side-effect
A = @B
A = -B
A = +C

// Prefix Unary operators with side-effect
A = @B
A = ++B
A = --C

// Postfix Unary operators with side-effect
A = B@
A = B++
A = C--

// Postfix Unary operators with no side-effect
A = B@
