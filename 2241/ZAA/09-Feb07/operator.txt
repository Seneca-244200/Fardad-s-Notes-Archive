Atype A;
Btype B;

@: operator, B and C are operands
A = B @ C :     Binary Operators (two operands)  with no side-effect
A = B + C : when + operator is done, will B or C change? answer NO
A = B - C;
A = B / C;

A = B += C;   when += operator is done, will B or C change?
               Binary Operators (two operands)  with side-effect

Atype Btype::operator+=(Ctype C);
Atype Btype::operator+=(const Ctype& C);

A = B -= C;
Atype Btype::operator-=(const Ctype&C);

cout << C;
???? can not be done since cout's source code is not ours to modify


A = @B;      Prefix Unary operators (one operand) with no side-effect
A = -B;
A = !B;

A = ++B;   Prefix Unary operators (one operand) with side-effect

Atype Btype::operator++();


A = B++;   Postfix Unary operators (one operand) with side-effect

Atyep Btype::operator++(int); // int mean this one is postfix not prefix

A = B--;
